NAME   
       randomips - generate random IP addresses

SYNOPSIS
       randomips [-b BASENAME] [-s NUM] NUMIPS

DESCRIPTION
       randomips generates NUMIPS random IPv4 addresses and outputs them to
       STDOUT or to a number of files if you specify a basename for
       the files. The generated IP addresses are not unique and do
       not take into account any IANA rules for IP address space.

OPTIONS
       -b BASENAME
          Output will be put into files basename[.NUM] where NUM
          is the part number if you split the generated list into
          several parts. If -s is not specified, the list will be
          saved to BASENAME.

       -h 
          Displays this help

       -s NUM
          Split the list into NUM parts. The last part will be smaller
          than the preceding parts if NUMIPS modulo NUM is non-zero..
