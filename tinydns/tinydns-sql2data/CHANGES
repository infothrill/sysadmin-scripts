version 2.0

- added some docs and support files
- SQL tables can have a prefix which is configurable
- code formatting
- POD (embedded man-page)
- disabled sending of dns-notifies (will be re-added in later versions)

initial release (1.14)
----------------------
- removed absolute tinydns paths (have to change cwd before execution...)
- removed 'mail' from Domains (non-technical)
- support for TTL in NSentry table
- support for empty Host NSentry, makes +domain:IP:TTL a possibility
                      (instead of only allowing +host.domain:IP:TTL)
- support for MX records in NSentry table (MX Priority/Distance ->SQL field 'Other')
- use File::Copy for portability and speed instead of "system('cp')"
- slightly more paranoid backups
- fix: do not use filenames starting with 'data', see tinydns-data manual
- improved system('make') for speed (no subshell) and error-handling
- command line options, help
- added built-in dns notify support for slaves supporting axfr on notify (e.g. Bind)
- ability to specify a dns-server to be excluded from notifies
- new option: -f (force)
- fix: escape \C for CNAMES corrected to plain 'C'
- now checks if static_data was modified too (->recompile)
- new: configuration file, no hardcoded mysql access stuff
- added root_dir option
- made the creation of new 'data' safe: atomic move (File::Copy)
- wildcard domain can be specified by setting 'Other' to "*" for A records.
  (the host itself is also added to data, in contrast to setting 'Host' to
  something like '*.host')
- new option for not executing 'make'
- backup is now disabled by default, have to specify '-b'
