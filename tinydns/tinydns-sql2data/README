INSTALL

Make sure you have tinydns installed and running correctly.
Create a new database called whatever you want and dump the file 'sql2data.sql'
into. Make sure you have a user with enough privileges to use SELECT statements
on that database.

Create a new configuration file from the 'sql2data.conf.sample' file and adjust
all settings.
Execute sql2data, eventually specifying '-c' for the config file and most
importantly '-b' for a first test-run.
